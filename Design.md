Project Name: **Bayleys Epic Workout App**

Project Author: **Cooper Holmes**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

My brother needs a way to help him track his workouts so he can see his progress overtime to see if he is improving in terms of weight and reps, But it is not easy for him to keep track of the amount of sets and reps he does, as he do0es many exercises in each workout, a website to help him keep track of this would be very helpful.

### End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

## Relevant Implications

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

I need to design my system to have no faults as I want the end-user to have as smooth of an experience as possible when using the system

When I am designing my website I will refer to nielsen's heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as best as possible, specifically I want my UI to do everything that it is supposed to do, and it meets it's purpose of tracking my brother's workouts. I want to ensure that their are no bugs in the entirety of my UI, all while it is entirely crash free. I also want to ensure that my brother can see that it is working from his point of view. To test this I will show my UI to my user and obtain valuable feedback.

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

I will need to design my system to be easy to use because my brother is not very good with technology compared to most people his age. I will need to make sure that anyone could use my website no matter what experience they have.
