# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Bayleys Epic Workout App**

Project Author: **Cooper Holmes**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

My brother needs a way to help him track his workouts so he can see his progress overtime to see if he is improving in terms of weight and reps, But it is not easy for him to keep track of the amount of sets and reps he does, as he do0es many exercises in each workout, a website to help him keep track of this would be very helpful.

### End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

I need to design my system to have no faults as I want the end-user to have as smooth of an experience as possible when using the system

When I am designing my website I will refer to nielsen's heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as best as possible, specifically I want my UI to do everything that it is supposed to do, and it meets it's purpose of tracking my brother's workouts. I want to ensure that their are no bugs in the entirety of my UI, all while it is entirely crash free. I also want to ensure that my brother can see that it is working from his point of view. To test this I will show my UI to my user and obtain valuable feedback.

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

I will need to design my system to be as usable as possible as the user may not be as experienced with It as i am, I will need to make sure my website could be used by anyone with any level if IT experience

When I am designing my website I will refer to nielsen's heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as best as possible, specifically I want my UI to Follow standard conventions, have everything in the correct place where it would normally be, I want the behaviour of the outcome to be familiar andd logical s anyone could make sense of it, And i want thr user to be given clear directions n what to do and have a clear way on how to undo/cancel. And i always want the user to be aware of what is happening, so they do not get confused if the system takes longer to do something than normal.

### Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how it looks in terms of design.

Aesthetics is important to my system as I want it to be appealing and catch the eye of the user. And it is important it follows the design conventions.

When I am designing my website I will refer to nielsen's heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as best as possible, specifically I want my UI to appeal to my user, meaning I will need to create designs and show it to the user to decide which they find most appealing, I want the design to be suitable for the outcomes purpose and not seem idiotic. I want to use colours and fonts that work together, to create a pleasing effect. I want everything to be correctly positioned so it doesn't seem unfamiliar.

### End-Users

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

I need to design my system to be meet the users needs so they can be comfortable using the website, and i need to ensure it works on the devices my brother would use.

When I am designing my website I will refer to nielsen's heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as best as possible, specifically I want my UI to know as much about the user as possible in terms of age, gender etc. I want it to use appropriate language so it doesn't seem unfamiliar and is comfortable to use. I will need to regular get feedback and always take it into account while I am designing the system. And I will need to ensure it works on many devices, as the user may use more than one device.

### Social

The social implications of a digital technology or digital outcome involve how it affects users, the wider community and society as a whole.

I need to design my system to not misrepresent any social groups or cause any offence and I want it too appeal to all social groups.

I will need to avoid putting in any racist or bigoted details in the system and using gender neutral pronouns whenever possible, all while avoiding the promotion of any drugs or bad activities.
